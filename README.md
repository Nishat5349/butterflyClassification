# Butterfly Classification 
It is a project work...
For this project, i collected dataset from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/butterfly-images40-species". Which contains Train, Test. Validation data set for 100 butterfly or moth species. All images are 224 X 224 X 3 in jpg format.

I applied **MobilenetV2** to train my model. I employ the **Adam optimizer** with a conservative learning rate of 0.0001. 


This is the model summary:
